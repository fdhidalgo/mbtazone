\title{Compute subtree aggregates using igraph C-level BFS (optimized)}
\usage{
compute_subtree_aggregates_fast(
  tree,
  root,
  capacity_aligned,
  area_aligned,
  forbidden_mask
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{igraph tree object}

\item{root}{Integer vertex index to use as root}

\item{capacity_aligned}{Numeric vector of capacities aligned to tree vertices}

\item{area_aligned}{Numeric vector of areas aligned to tree vertices}

\item{forbidden_mask}{Logical vector (TRUE if vertex is forbidden)}
}
\value{
List with aggregates and traversal metadata
}
\description{
Faster version that uses igraph::bfs() and preallocated vectors.
Accepts precomputed aligned vectors to avoid repeated match() calls.
}
