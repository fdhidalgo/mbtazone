\title{Remove a secondary block from state (for death move)}
\usage{
remove_secondary_block(
  state,
  block_id_to_remove,
  library,
  parcel_graph,
  neighbor_idx = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{Current state}

\item{library}{Secondary library}

\item{parcel_graph}{igraph object}

\item{neighbor_idx}{Optional integer neighbor indices for incremental updates}

\item{block_id}{Block ID to remove}
}
\value{
Updated state
}
\description{
Removes a secondary block from the state. The block must be in the current
secondary_blocks. Since secondaries are guaranteed disjoint (enforced by
add_secondary_block), all block parcels are removed from X.
