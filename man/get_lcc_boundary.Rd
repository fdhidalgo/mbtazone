\title{Get LCC boundary for local moves (excluding locked zone)}
\usage{
get_lcc_boundary(
  state,
  library,
  parcel_graph,
  neighbor_cache = NULL,
  neighbor_indices = NULL,
  degrees = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{Parcel MCMC state}

\item{library}{Secondary library}

\item{parcel_graph}{igraph object}

\item{neighbor_cache}{Optional named list of precomputed neighbors}

\item{neighbor_indices}{Optional named list of precomputed neighbor indices}
}
\value{
List with B_in (removable) and B_out (addable)
}
\description{
Returns parcels that are valid candidates for LCC toggle moves:
\itemize{
\item Inner boundary: LCC parcels with neighbors outside X
\item Outer boundary: Non-X parcels adjacent to LCC (but not to secondaries)
}
}
\details{
Uses integer index operations for fast boundary computation when neighbor_indices
is provided.
