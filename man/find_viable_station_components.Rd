\title{Find connected components of station-area parcels that can support valid LCCs}
\usage{
find_viable_station_components(parcel_graph, constraints)
}
\arguments{
\item{parcel_graph}{igraph with capacity_in_station and area_in_station vertex attributes}

\item{constraints}{Constraint list with min_capacity, min_area, station_capacity_pct, station_area_pct}
}
\value{
data.table with comp_id, n_parcels, station_cap, station_area, max_lcc_cap, max_lcc_area,
centroid_x/y, parcels (list), or NULL if no station constraint is active
}
\description{
A component is viable only if it can satisfy BOTH station constraints:
\itemize{
\item station_capacity_pct: \% of min_capacity that must be in station area
\item station_area_pct: \% of min_area that must be in station area
}
}
