  community_name = NULL,
  community_type = NULL,
  custom_requirements = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{community_name}{Optional character string with community name (e.g.,
"Cambridge", "Chelsea"). If provided with community_type, attempts to load
requirements from internal package data.}

\item{community_type}{Required character string specifying community category:
\itemize{
\item "rapid_transit" - Communities with rapid transit access
\item "commuter_rail" - Communities with commuter rail access
\item "adjacent" - Communities adjacent to MBTA service
\item "adjacent_small_town" - Adjacent small towns
}}

\item{custom_requirements}{Optional named list to override default requirements.
Can include: min_units, min_acres, min_station_area_acres,
station_area_unit_pct, station_area_land_pct, min_gross_density}
}
\value{
Named list with compliance requirements:
\itemize{
\item \code{min_units}: Minimum unit capacity required
\item \code{min_acres}: Minimum land area required (acres)
\item \code{min_station_area_acres}: Minimum developable acres in station areas
(rapid_transit and commuter_rail only)
\item \code{station_area_unit_pct}: Minimum percentage of units in station areas
(rapid_transit and commuter_rail only)
\item \code{station_area_land_pct}: Minimum percentage of land in station areas
(rapid_transit and commuter_rail only)
\item \code{min_gross_density}: Minimum units per acre (15 for all communities)
\item \code{community_type}: Community type used
\item \code{community_name}: Community name (if provided)
}
}
\description{
Load community-specific compliance requirements for MBTA Communities Act
evaluation. Requirements vary by community type and individual municipality.
}
\details{
Requirements are community-specific and loaded from internal package data when
both community_name and community_type are provided. If community data is not
available, generic requirements for the community type are returned.

All communities must meet the minimum gross density requirement of 15 units per acre.

Rapid transit and commuter rail communities have additional location requirements
for transit station areas.
