\title{Get addable secondary blocks for birth move}
\usage{
get_addable_blocks(state, library, constraints = NULL, lcc_capacity = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{Parcel MCMC state}

\item{library}{Secondary library}

\item{constraints}{Optional MBTA constraints for pre-screening}

\item{lcc_capacity}{Optional LCC capacity (required if constraints provided)}
}
\value{
Integer vector of addable block indices
}
\description{
A block is addable if:
\enumerate{
\item It is disjoint from current state (no overlap)
\item It is non-adjacent to current state (would create new component)
\item (Optional) Adding it would not violate capacity or LCC-fraction constraints
}
}
