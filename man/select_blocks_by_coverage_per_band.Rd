\title{Select blocks by coverage-aware greedy algorithm, stratified by band}
\usage{
select_blocks_by_coverage_per_band(
  candidate_blocks,
  max_total,
  parcel_names,
  band_column = "size_band",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{candidate_blocks}{data.table with parcel_ids and band_column columns}

\item{max_total}{Maximum total blocks to select across all bands}

\item{parcel_names}{Character vector of all parcel names}

\item{band_column}{Name of the column containing band identifiers (default "size_band")}

\item{verbose}{Print progress messages (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
data.table of selected blocks from all bands
}
\description{
Applies coverage-aware selection within each size band to ensure both
geographic diversity (via coverage) and size diversity (via band quotas).
This is more robust across municipalities with varying graph topologies.
