\title{Select blocks by coverage-aware greedy algorithm}
\usage{
select_blocks_by_coverage(
  candidate_blocks,
  max_size,
  parcel_names,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{candidate_blocks}{data.table with parcel_ids column (list of character vectors)}

\item{max_size}{Maximum number of blocks to select}

\item{parcel_names}{Character vector of all parcel names}

\item{verbose}{Print progress messages (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
data.table of selected blocks
}
\description{
Selects blocks to maximize geographic coverage. Each block is scored by how
much it improves coverage of under-covered parcels: score = sum(1/(coverage\link{p}+1)).
This naturally favors blocks in underrepresented areas.
}
\details{
Works with any block type (LCCs, secondaries) as long as the data.table has
a parcel_ids column containing character vectors of parcel IDs.
