\title{Discover secondary blocks via spanning tree enumeration}
\usage{
discover_secondaries_from_trees(
  parcel_graph,
  size_bands = list(c(5, 8), c(8, 12), c(12, 20)),
  density_threshold = 15,
  n_trees = 200L,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parcel_graph}{igraph parcel graph with capacity/area attributes}

\item{size_bands}{List of c(min_area, max_area) tuples in acres
Default: list(c(5, 8), c(8, 12), c(12, 20))}

\item{density_threshold}{Minimum density (units/acre) required. Default: 15}

\item{n_trees}{Number of spanning trees to sample (default 200)}

\item{verbose}{Print progress (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item discovered_secondaries: data.table with sec_key, parcel_ids, capacity,
area, size_band, tree_count, source
\item n_trees_sampled: number of trees successfully sampled
\item n_trees_failed: number of trees that failed to build
\item total_cuts_found: total number of valid cuts found (before deduplication)
\item unique_secondaries_found: number of unique blocks after deduplication
\item band_counts: named vector of counts per size band
}
}
\description{
Samples uniform random spanning trees and enumerates all valid secondary
block cuts. Parallel to discover_lccs_from_trees() but uses area bands
and density threshold instead of LCC constraints.
