}
\arguments{
\item{geometry_sf}{sf object with LOC_ID, geometry, capacity, area}

\item{buffer_dist}{Buffer distance for candidate edge detection (default 10 feet)}

\item{right_of_way_sf}{Optional sf object with ROW polygons}

\item{row_proximity_ft}{Max distance for cross-ROW adjacency}

\item{row_min_crossing_ft}{Min ROW crossing length}

\item{touch_threshold_ft}{Max distance to consider as "touching" (default 2 feet)}

\item{verbose}{Print progress messages}
}
\value{
igraph object with vertices from geometry_sf and edge attribute \code{is_row_crossing}
}
\description{
Creates an igraph object with parcels as vertices and adjacency edges.
Edges are validated to ensure parcels either physically touch OR are
connected across a valid ROW crossing. This prevents spurious edges
between parcels that are merely close but not truly adjacent.
