\title{Check if block has multiple boundary crossings (non-tree-cut)}
\usage{
count_boundary_crossings(block_parcels, parcel_graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{block_parcels}{Character vector of parcel IDs in block}

\item{parcel_graph}{igraph object}
}
\value{
Integer count of edges crossing the boundary
}
\description{
Tree cuts have exactly one edge crossing the boundary. Blocks with
multiple crossings cannot be represented as tree cuts and are the
primary target of BFS supplement exploration.
