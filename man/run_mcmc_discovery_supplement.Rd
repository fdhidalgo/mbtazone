List with:
\itemize{
\item discovered_lccs: data.table with lcc_key, parcel_ids, capacity, area

\item total_signatures: total LCC signatures collected
\item unique_lccs_found: number of unique LCCs discovered
}
}
\description{
Supplements tree discovery by exploring non-tree LCCs via lcc_local moves.
Tree enumeration only finds LCCs that are "tree cuts" (single edge crosses
the boundary). This function uses MCMC with 100\% lcc_local to explore nearby
configurations that might have multiple boundary crossings.
}
\details{
Each chain starts from a different tree-discovered LCC (selected for
diversity across capacity range) and explores locally.
