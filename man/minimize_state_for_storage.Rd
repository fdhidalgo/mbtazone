\title{Create minimal state for storage (strips runtime-only fields)}
\usage{
minimize_state_for_storage(state)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{Full parcel MCMC state}
}
\value{
Minimal state (list) suitable for storage
}
\description{
Keeps only fields needed for downstream analysis:
\itemize{
\item X (parcel IDs)
\item secondary_blocks (block IDs)
\item lcc_parcels (LCC parcel IDs)
\item total_capacity, total_area
}
}
\details{
Removes expensive runtime fields: X_indices, X_logical, lcc_logical,
lcc_neighbor_counts, X_neighbor_counts
}
