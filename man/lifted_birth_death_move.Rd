\description{
Non-reversible MCMC kernel that maintains direction across moves.
Unlike symmetric_birth_death which randomly chooses birth or death,
this kernel proposes moves in a persistent direction:
\itemize{
\item On acceptance: keep direction (momentum continues)
\item On rejection: flip direction (bounce back)
}
}
\details{
This creates "runs" of same-direction moves that traverse k faster,
improving mixing in the secondary block count dimension.

Satisfies global balance (not detailed balance) which is sufficient
for correct MCMC sampling. The marginal distribution over states
is the target distribution π(x).
