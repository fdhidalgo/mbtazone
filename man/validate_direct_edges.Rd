\title{Validate direct adjacency edges (vectorized)}
\usage{
validate_direct_edges(
  edges,
  geometry_sf,
  right_of_way_sf = NULL,
  touch_threshold_ft = 2,
  row_min_crossing_ft = ROW_MIN_CROSSING_LENGTH,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{edges}{data.table with "from" and "to" columns (parcel IDs)}

\item{geometry_sf}{sf object with LOC_ID and geometry (must be in meters CRS)}

\item{right_of_way_sf}{Optional sf object with ROW polygons}

\item{touch_threshold_ft}{Max distance (ft) to consider as "touching" (default 2)}

\item{row_min_crossing_ft}{Min ROW crossing length (ft) to validate cross-ROW edge}

\item{verbose}{Print progress messages}
}
\value{
Filtered data.table of validated edges
}
\description{
Filters candidate edges from buffered intersection to only keep edges where
parcels either physically touch OR are separated by a valid ROW crossing.
This prevents spurious edges between parcels that are merely close but not
truly adjacent.
}
\details{
Note: Assumes geometry_sf uses EPSG:26986 (meters). Thresholds are specified
in feet and converted internally.
