check_compliance_requirements(district_metrics, requirements, community_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{district_metrics}{Named list with calculated district metrics:
\itemize{
\item total_units: Total unit capacity
\item total_acres: Total land area in acres
\item developable_station_acres: Developable acres in station areas
\item gross_density: Units per acre (using density denominator)
\item station_area_units: Unit capacity in station areas
\item station_area_acres: Land area in station areas
}}

\item{requirements}{Named list from \code{\link{get_community_requirements}}}

\item{community_type}{Character string specifying community category}
}
\value{
Named list with compliance results:
\itemize{
\item \code{compliant}: Overall TRUE/FALSE
\item \code{requirements_met}: Named logical vector for each requirement
\item \code{failure_reasons}: Character vector of reasons for non-compliance
\item \code{summary}: Data frame with requirement details
}
}
\description{
Evaluate district metrics against the 6 MBTA Communities Act compliance
requirements. Returns pass/fail status for each requirement with detailed
explanations for failures.
}
\details{
The function evaluates these 6 requirements:

\strong{1. Minimum Unit Capacity} (all communities)
District must have at least the community-specific minimum unit capacity.

\strong{2. Minimum Land Area} (all communities)
District must have at least the community-specific minimum land area.

\strong{3. Developable Station Area} (rapid_transit and commuter_rail only)
Must have at least 100 acres of developable land within station areas.

\strong{4. Gross Density} (all communities)
Must achieve at least 15 units per acre using gross density denominator.

\strong{5. Unit Capacity Ratio in Station Areas} (rapid_transit and commuter_rail only)
Specified percentage of unit capacity must be within station areas.

\strong{6. Land Area Ratio in Station Areas} (rapid_transit and commuter_rail only)
Specified percentage of land area must be within station areas.
