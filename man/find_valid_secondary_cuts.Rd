\title{Find all valid secondary block cuts of a spanning tree}
\usage{
find_valid_secondary_cuts(
  tree,
  root,
  aggregates,
  size_bands,
  density_threshold
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{igraph tree object}

\item{root}{Integer root vertex}

\item{aggregates}{Output from compute_subtree_aggregates_fast()}

\item{size_bands}{List of c(min_area, max_area) tuples in acres}

\item{density_threshold}{Minimum density (units/acre) required}
}
\value{
List of valid cut specifications, each containing:
\itemize{
\item vertex: the vertex whose parent edge is cut
\item side: "subtree" or "complement" indicating which side is the block
\item capacity: total capacity of the block
\item area: total area of the block
\item size_band: which band this block falls into (index)
}
}
\description{
Each non-root vertex v defines a potential cut: removing edge (v, parent\link{v})
splits the tree into the subtree rooted at v and its complement.
A cut is valid if the resulting component satisfies secondary block constraints
(area within band, density >= threshold).
