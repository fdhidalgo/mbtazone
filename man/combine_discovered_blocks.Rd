\title{Combine tree and BFS discovered blocks (generalized)}
\usage{
combine_discovered_blocks(
  tree_discovered,
  bfs_discovered,
  key_column = "lcc_key",
  block_type = "LCC",
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree_discovered}{Output from discover_*_from_trees()}

\item{bfs_discovered}{Output from run_bfs_*_supplement()}

\item{key_column}{Column name for deduplication key ("lcc_key" or "sec_key")}

\item{block_type}{Character label for logging ("LCC" or "secondary")}

\item{verbose}{Print progress (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
List with combined discovered_blocks in same format as tree discovery
}
\description{
Merges block discoveries from tree enumeration and BFS exploration.
Deduplicates by key column and tracks source (tree, bfs, or both).
Works for both LCC and secondary block discoveries.
