\title{Calculate Component Totals for Infeasibility Checking}
\usage{
calculate_component_totals(
  parcels,
  adj,
  capacity_col = "unit_capacity",
  area_col = "SQFT"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parcels}{An sf data frame with parcel data}

\item{adj}{An adjacency list (output from build_adjacency())}

\item{capacity_col}{Name of column containing unit capacity (default: "unit_capacity")}

\item{area_col}{Name of column containing area in square feet (default: "SQFT")}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{component_id}: Integer vector of component IDs for each parcel
\item \code{total_capacity}: Numeric vector of total capacity per component
\item \code{total_area}: Numeric vector of total area (acres) per component
\item \code{n_components}: Number of connected components
}
}
\description{
Precompute total capacity and area for each connected component. This
enables O(1) infeasibility checks during SMC particle propagation (Tier 2).
}
\details{
During SMC propagation, particles track which connected component they're in
and use these precomputed totals to determine if they can possibly reach
the minimum capacity/area requirements. This enables early termination of
infeasible particles (Tier 2 checking).
