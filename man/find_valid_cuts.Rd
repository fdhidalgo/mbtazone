\title{Find all valid LCC cuts of a spanning tree}
\usage{
find_valid_cuts(
  tree,
  root,
  aggregates,
  constraints,
  max_discovery_capacity = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{igraph tree object}

\item{root}{Integer root vertex}

\item{aggregates}{Output from compute_subtree_aggregates()}

\item{constraints}{MBTA constraints list}

\item{max_discovery_capacity}{Optional upper bound for discovery efficiency.
LCCs with capacity above this are skipped. Default NULL (no bound).}
}
\value{
List of valid cut specifications, each containing:
\itemize{
\item vertex: the vertex whose parent edge is cut
\item side: "subtree" or "complement" indicating which side is the LCC
\item capacity: total capacity of the LCC
\item area: total area of the LCC
}
}
\description{
Each non-root vertex v defines a potential cut: removing edge (v, parent\link{v})
splits the tree into the subtree rooted at v and its complement.
A cut is valid if the resulting component can serve as an LCC candidate
(min_area, min_density, and capacity >= min_capacity * min_lcc_fraction).
Note: LCC candidates need not be standalone-feasible; secondaries may
supply capacity to reach min_capacity in the final plan.
