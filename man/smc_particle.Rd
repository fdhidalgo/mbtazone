\title{Particle State Tracking for SMC Algorithm}
\description{
Functions to manage particle state during Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
simulation of MBTA overlay zoning districts. Implements 3-tier checking
architecture for efficient propagation: Tier 1 (running sums), Tier 2
(infeasibility tests), and Tier 3 (completion checks).
