\title{Partition parcels into regions based on station constraint feasibility}
\usage{
partition_parcels_by_station_feasibility(
  parcel_graph,
  constraints,
  n_regions = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parcel_graph}{igraph object with station coverage attributes}

\item{constraints}{Constraint list with min_capacity, station_capacity_pct}

\item{n_regions}{Number of regions (chains) to create}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item region_assignments: named vector (parcel_id -> "R1", "R2", etc.)
\item seed_pools: list of parcel ID vectors for each region's seed parcels
\item viable_components: data.table of viable components (NULL if quadrant fallback)
\item selected_indices: which components were selected (NULL if quadrant fallback)
\item n_regions: actual number of regions created
}
}
\description{
When station constraints are active, partitions based on viable station
components to guarantee all chains can satisfy station coverage requirements.
When station constraints are not active (NULL, NA, or 0), falls back to
simple geographic (quadrant) partitioning for chain diversity.
