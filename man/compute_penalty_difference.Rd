\title{Compute penalty difference for MH acceptance}
\usage{
compute_penalty_difference(
  current_cap,
  proposed_cap,
  constraints,
  lambda = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_cap}{Current state capacity}

\item{proposed_cap}{Proposed state capacity}

\item{constraints}{Constraint list with min_capacity}

\item{lambda}{Capacity prior strength (default: CAPACITY_PRIOR_LAMBDA from config)}
}
\value{
Log penalty difference to add to MH ratio
}
\description{
Returns penalty(current) - penalty(proposed) for log MH ratio.
Positive value favors accepting the proposal (proposed has lower penalty).
}
