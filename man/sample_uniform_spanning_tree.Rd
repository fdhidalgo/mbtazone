\title{Sample a uniform random spanning tree using Wilson's algorithm}
\usage{
sample_uniform_spanning_tree(graph)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{igraph object (should be connected; disconnected vertices skipped)}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item tree: igraph tree object with connected vertices
\item success: TRUE if spanning tree was built successfully
\item n_in_tree: Number of vertices in tree
}
}
\description{
Uses loop-erased random walks to generate a spanning tree uniformly
at random from the set of all spanning trees of the graph.

more quickly than the cover time.
