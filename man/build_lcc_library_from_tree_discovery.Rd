\title{Build LCC library from spanning tree discovery}
\usage{
build_lcc_library_from_tree_discovery(
  discovered_lccs,
  parcel_graph,
  max_library_size = 5000,
  bfs_reservation = 500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{discovered_lccs}{data.table from discover_lccs_from_trees() or
combine_discovered_lccs(). Expected columns: lcc_key, parcel_ids (list),
capacity, area, tree_count, source (optional)}

\item{parcel_graph}{igraph object}

\item{max_library_size}{Maximum number of LCCs to include (default 5000)}

\item{bfs_reservation}{Slots to reserve for BFS-only discoveries (default 500)}
}
\value{
Block library structure matching build_lcc_library() output
}
\description{
Converts LCCs discovered via spanning tree enumeration into the standard
library format for use in replace-LCC moves. Unlike MCMC discovery which
has visit counts, tree discovery uses tree_count (number of trees that
found each cut) for prioritization.
}
\details{
When combining tree and BFS discoveries, this function reserves slots for
BFS-only LCCs to ensure the hybrid supplement is preserved even when
tree discoveries exceed the library size limit.

Selection uses coverage-aware greedy algorithm that maximizes geographic
coverage by favoring LCCs that cover under-represented parcels.
