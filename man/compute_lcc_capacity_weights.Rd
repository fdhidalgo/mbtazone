\title{Compute weights for LCC selection (uniform)}
\usage{
compute_lcc_capacity_weights(lcc_ids, lcc_library)
}
\arguments{
\item{lcc_ids}{Integer vector of LCC candidate IDs}

\item{lcc_library}{LCC library with metadata$capacity}
}
\value{
List with weights, log_weights, log_sum_w
}
\description{
Returns uniform weights for LCC selection. Previously used capacity-aware
weighting (slack^lambda), but this was removed because it created a trap:
when secondary_cap is high, all high-capacity LCCs get near-zero weight,
preventing the chain from escaping (low LCC cap, high secondary count) states.
}
\details{
MH acceptance handles capacity preference through the capacity prior, so
uniform proposal weights are sufficient and avoid the trap.
