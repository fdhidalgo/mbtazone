\title{Identify parcels to preserve as singleton units}
\usage{
identify_atomic_parcels(g, area_threshold = MACRO_ATOMIC_THRESHOLD)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{igraph object with area vertex attribute}

\item{area_threshold}{Minimum area (acres) for singleton treatment}
}
\value{
Character vector of parcel IDs (LOC_IDs) to freeze as singletons
}
\description{
Parcels with area >= threshold are "atomic" - they become their own
unit without being merged with neighbors. This preserves geographic
granularity for large parcels that can serve as standalone secondary
components.
