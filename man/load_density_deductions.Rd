\title{Load Gross Density Denominator Deduction Layer}
\usage{
load_density_deductions(deduction_shapefile = NULL, projection = 26986)
}
\arguments{
\item{deduction_shapefile}{Optional path to density deduction shapefile (character).
If NULL (default), uses package-provided statewide layer.}

\item{projection}{Target EPSG code for projection (default: 26986 for
Massachusetts State Plane NAD83). Data will be transformed to this projection
if needed.}
}
\value{
An sf object containing density deduction polygons:
\itemize{
\item Multiple POLYGON features representing areas excluded from density calculations
\item Geometry in specified projection (default EPSG:26986)
\item Metadata attributes: source_file, crs_epsg, load_date, n_features
\item Additional class "mbtazone_density_deductions" for method dispatch
}
}
\description{
Load statewide gross density denominator deduction layer for calculating
district-level gross density. This layer represents areas that must be excluded
from the gross density denominator calculation.
}
\details{
This function loads the statewide Gross Density Denominator Deductions layer
provided by EOHLC. The layer contains polygons representing areas that must be
subtracted from total district area when calculating gross density
(units per acre requirement).

The default shapefile is included in the package at
\code{inst/extdata/statewide/Density_Denominator_Deductions.zip}.

\strong{Note:} This is a large dataset (87,000+ features, ~372MB) and may take
5-10 seconds to load.
