\title{Get addable blocks without constraint pre-screening}
\usage{
get_addable_blocks_unconstrained(state, library)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{Parcel MCMC state}

\item{library}{Secondary library}
}
\value{
Integer vector of addable block indices
}
\description{
For MH ratio computation in multi-birth/death moves, the reverse
probability must use the same proposal distribution as forward.
This helper returns ALL geometrically valid blocks, ignoring
capacity and LCC-fraction constraints. Feasibility is checked
separately after the full proposal is made.
