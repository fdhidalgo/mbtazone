\title{Add a secondary block to state (for birth move)}
\usage{
add_secondary_block(
  state,
  block_id_to_add,
  library,
  parcel_graph,
  neighbor_idx = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{state}{Current state}

\item{library}{Secondary library}

\item{parcel_graph}{igraph object}

\item{neighbor_idx}{Optional integer neighbor indices for incremental updates}

\item{block_id}{Block ID to add}
}
\value{
Updated state
}
\description{
Adds a secondary block that must be disjoint from the current overlay.
Throws an error if the block overlaps X, as this indicates an upstream bug
(e.g., stale X_logical, wrong indices, or corrupted library).
}
