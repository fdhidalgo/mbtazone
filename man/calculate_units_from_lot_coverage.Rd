\title{Calculate Units from Lot Coverage Limits}
\usage{
calculate_units_from_lot_coverage(lot_area, max_lot_coverage, building_height)
}
\arguments{
\item{lot_area}{Numeric vector of total lot areas in square feet}

\item{max_lot_coverage}{Numeric value of maximum lot coverage as decimal
(e.g., 0.7 for 70\%) from zoning parameters}

\item{building_height}{Numeric value of maximum building height in stories}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of unit counts. Returns NA when max_lot_coverage is NA
(no coverage limit).
}
\description{
Determines the maximum units allowed based on lot coverage limits. This is
Excel column Z.
}
\details{
Formula: units = (lot_area * max_lot_coverage * building_height) / 1000

Uses 1000 sq ft per unit standard. When max_lot_coverage is NA, there is no
coverage restriction and NA is returned (treated as Inf in final capacity).

This corresponds to Excel column Z.
}
\examples{
# 10,000 sq ft lot, 70\% coverage, 7 stories
calculate_units_from_lot_coverage(10000, 0.7, 7)
# Returns: (10000 * 0.7 * 7) / 1000 = 49

# No coverage limit
calculate_units_from_lot_coverage(10000, NA, 7)
# Returns: NA
