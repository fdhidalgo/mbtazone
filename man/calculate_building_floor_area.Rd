\title{Calculate Building Floor Area}
\usage{
calculate_building_floor_area(building_footprint, building_height)
}
\arguments{
\item{building_footprint}{Numeric vector of building footprint areas (from
\code{\link{calculate_building_footprint}})}

\item{building_height}{Numeric value of maximum building height in stories
from zoning parameters}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of building floor areas in square feet. Returns 0
for parcels with zero or negative footprint.
}
\description{
Computes the total building floor area (building envelope) by multiplying
footprint by height. This is Excel column W.
}
\details{
Formula: building_floor_area = building_footprint * building_height

Building height must be specified in stories (not feet). Divide feet by 10
to convert to stories per MBTA model conventions.

Only applies to parcels with positive building footprint.
}
\examples{
# 7-story building
calculate_building_floor_area(
  building_footprint = 4400,
  building_height = 7
)
# Returns: 4400 * 7 = 30800

# No footprint available
calculate_building_floor_area(
  building_footprint = 0,
  building_height = 7
)
# Returns: 0

}
