\title{Compute capacity prior penalty for a state}
\usage{
compute_capacity_penalty(capacity, min_cap, lambda = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{capacity}{Current total capacity}

\item{min_cap}{Minimum capacity constraint}

\item{lambda}{Penalty strength (default: CAPACITY_PRIOR_LAMBDA from config)}
}
\value{
Numeric penalty value (>= 0, where 0 means at minimum)
}
\description{
Returns penalty value (>= 0) for capacity above min_capacity.
Zero penalty when capacity equals min_capacity (minimum legal requirement).
}
\details{
NOTE: min_capacity is enforced as a HARD constraint (legal mandate)
and is checked in check_hard_constraints_only(). This penalty function
applies a soft prior ABOVE min_capacity to favor staying near the minimum.

Uses linear form:
penalty = lambda * (cap - min_cap)  if cap > min_cap
= 0                         otherwise
}
