\title{Combine all LCC discovery sources (tree, BFS boundary, BFS stratified)}
\usage{
combine_all_lcc_discoveries(
  tree_discovered,
  bfs_discovered,
  bfs_stratified,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree_discovered}{Output from discover_lccs_from_trees()}

\item{bfs_discovered}{Output from run_bfs_lcc_supplement()}

\item{bfs_stratified}{Output from discover_lccs_by_capacity_bands()}

\item{verbose}{Print progress. Default: TRUE.}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item discovered_blocks: combined data.table
\item n_tree: count from tree discovery
\item n_bfs: count from BFS boundary supplement
\item n_stratified: count from BFS capacity-stratified
\item n_combined: total unique after deduplication
}
}
\description{
Extends combine_discovered_blocks to handle three LCC discovery sources:
\itemize{
\item Tree enumeration (uniform coverage of tree-cut LCCs)
\item BFS boundary supplement (multi-crossing LCCs)
\item BFS capacity-stratified (targets low-capacity bands)
}
}
\details{
Deduplicates by lcc_key and tracks source provenance.
