# High-Discrepancy Municipality Investigation Summary

## Overview

Investigated 5 municipalities with large unit capacity discrepancies (>25% difference between R package and Excel):

| Municipality | Unit Discrepancy | Acreage Ratio | Duplicate Features? | Root Cause |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| **Westford** | +283% (2,300 vs 601) | 2.59x | ‚ö†Ô∏è **YES** | Multiple features per LOC_ID in shapefile |
| **Harvard** | +104% (594 vs 291) | 2.03x | ‚úÖ No | Geometry mismatch (shapefile ‚â† Excel boundaries) |
| **Wayland** | +76% (461 vs 262) | 1.76x | ‚úÖ No | Geometry mismatch (shapefile ‚â† Excel boundaries) |
| **Wellesley** | +58% (832 vs 527) | 1.54x | ‚úÖ No | Geometry mismatch (shapefile ‚â† Excel boundaries) |
| **Worcester** | +29% (56,132 vs 43,616) | 1.00x | ‚úÖ No | **UNKNOWN** - needs further investigation |

## Key Findings

### Pattern 1: Duplicate Features (Westford Only)

**Issue:** Shapefile contains 2-5 geographic features per LOC_ID
**Impact:** Acreage and unit capacity multiplied by 2-5x per parcel
**Root Cause:** Each parcel has multiple polygon features in shapefile (multipolygons or actual duplicates)

**Example Parcels:**
- F_671058_3022467: Excel 15.12 acres ‚Üí Shapefile 39.10 acres (2.6x)
- F_669591_3024300: Excel 9.14 acres ‚Üí Shapefile 38.57 acres (4.2x)
- F_670261_3023814: Excel 5.09 acres ‚Üí Shapefile 25.21 acres (5.0x)

**Recommendation:**
- Flag Westford as "Data Quality Issue - Duplicate Features"
- Skip Method 1 validation (Excel parcel list)
- Attempt Method 2 validation (shapefile boundary) if available

---

### Pattern 2: Geometry Mismatch (Harvard, Wayland, Wellesley)

**Issue:** Shapefile parcel boundaries don't match Excel parcel data
**Impact:** Acreage is 1.5-2x higher in shapefile, directly causing unit overcounting
**Root Cause:** Excel and shapefile use different parcel geometries (different vintages, data sources, or manual edits)

**No Duplicate Features:** Each LOC_ID has exactly 1 feature in shapefile

**Acreage Comparison:**

| Municipality | Excel Acres | Shapefile Acres | Ratio | Units Discrepancy |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|-------------------|
| **Harvard** | 8.00 | 16.29 | 2.03x | +104% |
| **Wayland** | 9.72 | 17.09 | 1.76x | +76% |
| **Wellesley** | 33.47 | 51.62 | 1.54x | +58% |

**Observations:**
- Acreage ratio matches unit discrepancy almost exactly
- This confirms shapefile geometry is the problem
- NOT a calculation bug in R package

**Possible Causes:**
1. Excel used older/different parcel boundary data
2. Excel manually edited parcel boundaries
3. Shapefile was updated after Excel model created
4. Different data sources entirely (e.g., assessor vs. GIS department)

**Recommendation:**
- Flag as "Data Quality Issue - Geometry Mismatch"
- Cannot validate calculation accuracy with mismatched geometries
- Skip Method 1 validation
- Note: Method 2 might work if district boundary is provided

---

### Pattern 3: Perfect Acreage Match, Units Mismatch (Worcester)

**Issue:** R package calculates 56,132 units, Excel shows 43,616 (+29%)
**Acreage Match:** Shapefile 410.08 acres, Excel 409.81 acres (0.1% difference - essentially perfect!)
**Duplicate Features:** None (395 LOC_IDs = 395 features)

**Conclusion:** This is **NOT** a geometry/acreage issue

**Possible Causes:**
1. Missing zoning constraints (FAR, max_units_per_lot, etc.) not extracted from Excel
2. Excel uses different calculation logic or manual overrides
3. Excel applies constraints not visible in Checklist Parameters sheet
4. R package calculation bug (less likely given Maynard/others validate perfectly)

**Recommendation:**
- Requires manual Excel column-by-column investigation
- Check for:
  - Override values in Excel Column O (Override Developable)
  - Custom formulas in Excel calculation columns
  - Hidden constraints in parameter sheet
  - Manual unit capacity adjustments

## Broader Implications for Validation

### Data Quality Check Needed

**All shapefiles should be checked for:**

1. **Duplicate Features:**
   ```r
   parcel_counts <- parcels_sf %>%
     group_by(LOC_ID) %>%
     summarize(n_features = n())

   has_duplicates <- any(parcel_counts$n_features > 1)
   ```

2. **Geometry Mismatch:**
   ```r
   excel_total_acres <- sum(excel_parcels$acres, na.rm = TRUE)
   shapefile_total_acres <- sum(parcels_sf$ACRES, na.rm = TRUE)
   acreage_ratio <- shapefile_total_acres / excel_total_acres

   # Flag if ratio > 1.05 or < 0.95
   has_geometry_mismatch <- acreage_ratio > 1.05 | acreage_ratio < 0.95
   ```

3. **LOT_ACRES Alternative:**
   - Some shapefiles may have both `ACRES` and `LOT_ACRES` columns
   - Check if `LOT_ACRES` matches Excel better than `ACRES`
   - May need to use `LOT_ACRES` for calculation instead

### Method 1 Validation Feasibility

| Data Issue | Can Use Method 1? | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| Perfect match | ‚úÖ Yes | Ideal scenario |
| Small discrepancy (<5%) | ‚úÖ Yes | Acceptable tolerance |
| Duplicate features | ‚ùå No | Causes 2-5x overcounting |
| Geometry mismatch (>10%) | ‚ùå No | Cannot validate calculations |
| Unknown discrepancy (Worcester) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Maybe | Needs investigation |

---

### Method 2 Validation Status

**All municipalities should attempt Method 2** (shapefile boundary) where district boundaries are available.

**Advantages:**
- Uses spatial assignment instead of Excel parcel list
- May correctly handle multipolygon parcels
- Tests end-to-end workflow

**Requirements:**
- District boundary shapefile must be available
- District boundary must be usable (valid CRS, geometries, etc.)

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Validation Script Updates)

1. **Add Data Quality Checks** to `dev/systematic_validation.R`:
   ```r
   # Check 1: Duplicate features
   check_duplicate_features(parcels_sf)

   # Check 2: Acreage mismatch
   check_acreage_ratio(excel_parcels, parcels_sf)

   # Check 3: Try LOT_ACRES if available
   if ("LOT_ACRES" %in% names(parcels_sf)) {
     check_lot_acres_match(excel_parcels, parcels_sf)
   }
   ```

2. **Update Validation Logic:**
   - Skip Method 1 if duplicate features detected
   - Skip Method 1 if acreage ratio > 1.10 or < 0.90
   - Flag data quality issues in results tables

3. **Enhanced Reporting:**
   - Add "Data Quality" column to summary tables
   - Document failure reasons by category
   - List municipalities that need investigation

---

### Medium-Term (Package Enhancements)

1. **Add `dissolve_by_id` Parameter** to `load_municipality()`:
   - Combine multipolygon features by LOC_ID
   - Would enable Westford validation
   - Needs careful attribute aggregation logic

2. **Add `use_lot_acres` Parameter**:
   - Option to use `LOT_ACRES` instead of `ACRES`
   - Test if this resolves Harvard/Wayland/Wellesley mismatches

3. **Add Validation Function:**
   ```r
   validate_parcel_data <- function(excel_parcels, parcels_sf) {
     # Returns list of data quality issues
     # - duplicate_features: TRUE/FALSE
     # - acreage_ratio: numeric
     # - geometry_mismatch: TRUE/FALSE
     # - recommended_method: "Method 1", "Method 2 only", "Skip"
   }
   ```

---

### Long-Term (Data Standardization)

1. **Request Updated Parcel Shapefiles:**
   - Match Excel model vintages
   - Single feature per LOC_ID
   - Consistent column naming

2. **Excel Model Standardization:**
   - Document approved custom formulas (like Grafton's)
   - Standardize override column usage
   - Version control for model updates

3. **Municipality Outreach:**
   - Flag data quality issues
   - Request explanation for discrepancies
   - Verify intentional vs. accidental customizations

---

## Investigation Priority

**Next municipalities to investigate:**

1. **Worcester** (High Priority)
   - Perfect acreage match but 29% unit discrepancy
   - Large district (395 parcels)
   - Likely missing constraint or Excel override issue

2. **Remaining High-Discrepancy Municipalities:**
   - Review systematic validation results for others with >25% differences
   - Check for similar patterns

3. **Small Discrepancies (<5%):**
   - May be rounding differences
   - Lower priority unless patterns emerge
