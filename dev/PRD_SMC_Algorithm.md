# SMC Algorithm for MBTA Zoning Simulation

## Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 2.0 (Revised with Valuation-Guided RSIS Methodology)
**Date:** October 10, 2025
**Status:** Design Phase

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document specifies a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm to generate a reference distribution of possible MBTA overlay zoning plans that comply with Massachusetts General Law Chapter 40A Section 3A. The SMC approach builds zoning districts incrementally by adding parcels one at a time, resampling at each step to maintain feasibility. This is more efficient than MCMC for generating diverse, compliant plans.

**Key Innovation:** Unlike political redistricting which requires complete space-filling partitions, MBTA zoning creates partial coverage (selecting ~50-100 parcels from 5,000+). SMC naturally handles this by growing zones from seed parcels, making the computational problem highly tractable.

**Integration with Existing Package:** This feature builds on the existing `mbtazone` compliance calculation engine (Phases 1-2 of original PRD, now complete). The SMC algorithm will leverage existing functions like `evaluate_compliance()`, `calculate_district_capacity()`, and `precompute_spatial_attributes()` for performance and code reuse.

**API Design:** The package follows the `redist` package's tidy interface pattern with `mbta_map` objects, `mbta_smc()` as the main simulation function, and `mbta_plans` objects for analysis.

## 2. Research Objectives

### Primary Research Question

Do adopted MBTA overlay zones exhibit systematic bias in their demographic or economic composition relative to all feasible alternative configurations?

### Specific Comparisons

1. **Racial composition:** Does the adopted zone concentrate or avoid minority populations?
2. **Economic indicators:** Property values, median income, rental prices
3. **Existing land use:** Industrial/commercial vs. residential patterns
4. **Infrastructure proximity:** Transit stops, commercial corridors
5. **Development potential:** Redevelopment likelihood based on current vs. maximum use intensity

### Null Hypothesis

The adopted plan is drawn from a uniform distribution over all feasible plans that meet minimum statutory requirements.

**Implementation Note:** The SMC algorithm uses soft penalties during particle propagation for computational efficiency (guiding particles toward feasible, contiguous configurations and reducing particle death rates). After SMC completes, Sampling/Importance Resampling (SIR) is applied to correct for the penalized exploration distribution, restoring a true uniform distribution over compliant configurations. The final reference distribution used for hypothesis testing is uniform.

### Academic Contribution

This work extends redistricting simulation methods (Fifield et al. 2020; McCartan & Imai 2020) to partial-coverage zoning problems, providing first-of-its-kind tools for detecting bias in municipal land use decisions.

## 3. Problem Formulation

### 3.1 Graph Representation

**Geographic units as graph:**

- **Nodes (V):** Individual parcels in the municipality
- **Edges (E):** Connect parcels that share a physical boundary (contiguity)
- **Graph:** G = (V, E) is undirected

**Parcel attributes** (from existing package data structures):

- `parcel_id`: Unique identifier (LOC_ID column)
- `lot_area`: Land area in square feet (SQFT column)
- `unit_capacity`: Maximum units under MBTA zoning parameters (calculated via `calculate_final_unit_capacity()`)
- `station_distance`: Distance to nearest rapid transit station
- `in_station_area`: Boolean for 0.5 mile buffer (calculated via `calculate_station_area_overlap()`)
- `developable_area`: Area available for development (calculated via `calculate_developable_area()`)
- `excluded_area`: Excluded/sensitive land (Tot_Exclud, Tot_Sensit columns)
- Census block group attributes: race, income, property values (joined from external data)

### 3.2 State Space

**Configuration:** A binary vector **x** ∈ {0,1}^N where:

- x_i = 1 if parcel i is in MBTA overlay zone
- x_i = 0 otherwise

**Valid configuration Ω:** The set {x : x satisfies all constraints}

### 3.3 Constraints

All configurations must satisfy the same constraints enforced by existing `evaluate_compliance()` function:

**Hard constraints (must be satisfied):**

1. **Contiguity:** At least 50% of district area must be in a single contiguous portion; remaining portions must be ≥5 acres each (validated by `validate_contiguity()`)
2. **Station proximity:** Proportion of district in station areas must meet threshold (sliding scale by municipality type)
3. **Minimum capacity:** Σ(x_i × capacity_i) ≥ minimum_units (community-specific, from `community_info.csv`)
4. **Minimum acreage:** Σ(x_i × area_i) ≥ minimum_acres (typically 50 acres)
5. **Gross density:** (Σ capacity_i) / (Σ area_i) ≥ 15 units/acre (calculated by `calculate_district_capacity()`)

> **Important: Contiguity vs. Station Area Coverage**
>
> Two distinct requirements that both involve percentages:
>
> 1. **Contiguity (50%)**: At least 50% of district **area** must be in a single contiguous (spatially connected) portion. Remaining area can be in separate portions ≥5 acres each.
>
>    - Source: 760 CMR 59.04(3)(d)
>    - Enforced by: `validate_contiguity()` (R/gis_operations.R:1019-1216)
>    - Check: Geographic connectedness of parcel boundaries
>
> 2. **Station Coverage (50-90%)**: Percentage of district required within 0.5-mile transit station buffers. This is a **dual-metric requirement**:
>
>    - **Both** land area % AND unit capacity % must meet the threshold
>    - `station_area / total_area ≥ threshold`
>    - `station_capacity / total_capacity ≥ threshold`
>
>    **Sliding scale by developable station area** (from Compliance Model Guidelines Table 2):
>
>    - Rapid Transit communities: 90% coverage required
>    - Commuter Rail communities:
>      - ≥30 acres developable in station area: 50% coverage required
>      - <30 acres developable in station area: Lower threshold (sliding scale)
>    - Adjacent communities: Lower thresholds based on developable station area
>
>    Source: Compliance Model User Guide, Table 2
>    Enforced by: `calculate_station_area_percentage()` (checks both metrics)
>
> These are independent requirements checked separately.

**Soft constraints (enforced via penalty function, not hard cutoffs):** 6. **Compactness:** Zones should be reasonably compact (not sprawling) 7. **Efficiency:** Zones should not vastly exceed minimums

- Penalty for: capacity > α × minimum_units or area > α × minimum_acres
- Suggested α = 1.25 (configurable)
- **Note:** This is enforced via penalty function only, not as a hard termination rule. This avoids truncating the state space and biasing the distribution.

**Rationale for efficiency bound:** Empirically, municipalities target minimum requirements. Without this soft constraint, SMC would favor larger zones. Setting α as a configurable parameter with sensitivity analysis allows assessment of impact on results.

**Implementation Note:** All constraint validation will use existing package functions rather than reimplementing compliance logic.

## 4. Sequential Monte Carlo Algorithm Design

### 4.1 Why SMC for MBTA Zoning?

This implementation uses a modern SMC framework known as Sequential Importance Sampling with Resampling (RSIS).

**Advantages over MCMC and Pure SIS for this problem:**

1. **Natural for partial coverage:** RSIS builds zones sequentially.
2. **Enhanced Efficiency via Resampling:** RSIS uses intermediate resampling to concentrate computational effort on promising partial solutions, significantly improving efficiency over Pure SIS (which lacks resampling).
3. **Valuation-Guided Exploration:** Resampling is guided by a **Valuation Function V(x)**, which estimates the potential of a partial plan based on lookahead metrics (Tier 2 optimizations). This guides the search effectively without needing to define complex intermediate targets (as required by standard tempering).
4. **Handles hard constraints efficiently:** Tier 2 checks prune infeasible paths early, and resampling eliminates low-potential particles.
5. **Mathematically Robust:** By rigorously tracking the proposal probability Q(x) and correctly handling resampling, RSIS guarantees correct importance weights, ensuring sampling from the desired target distribution.

**Integration with existing package performance optimization:**

The SMC algorithm will leverage the existing `precompute_spatial_attributes()` workflow for ~1000x speedup when evaluating thousands of candidate zones:

```r
# One-time precomputation (existing function)
parcels_precomputed <- precompute_spatial_attributes(
  municipality = parcels,
  station_areas = transit_stations,
  density_deductions = density_layers,
  verbose = TRUE
)

# SMC uses precomputed parcels for all compliance evaluations
plans <- mbta_smc(
  map = mbta_map(parcels_precomputed, precomputed = TRUE),
  nsims = 10000
)
```

**How RSIS works for zoning (Revised):**

```
1. Initialize M active particles (potential zones) from seed parcels.
2. Initialize log_proposal_path = 0 for all particles.
3. While active particles remain:
    a. Propagation: For each active particle:
        - Propose adding a parcel using proposal distribution Q (heuristics).
        - Update log_proposal_path (tracking Q(x)).
        - Check viability (Tier 1 & 2).
        - Calculate Valuation Score V(x) based on lookahead metrics.
    b. Completion Check (Tier 3):
        - If a particle completed (met minimums):
        - Calculate final Importance Weight W_explore = π_explore(x) / Q(x).
        - Move particle to Completed population.
    c. Resampling (Active Population):
        - If ESS of active particles (weighted by V(x)) drops too low, resample.
        - CRITICAL: Copy all state, including the cumulative log_proposal_path.
4. Final completed particles are weighted samples approximating the exploration distribution (π_explore).
5. Apply SIR correction to restore the uniform distribution (π_uniform).
```

### 4.2 Target Distribution

The algorithm uses a two-stage approach: (1) penalized exploration during SMC for computational efficiency, then (2) SIR correction to restore uniform distribution.

#### 4.2.1 Exploration Target (During SMC)

We define an Exploration Target Distribution $\pi_{explore}$ that incorporates the soft penalties (compactness, efficiency). Sampling from this distribution improves the Effective Sample Size (ESS) for the final SIR correction.

**Exploration Target Distribution $\pi_{explore}$:**

$\pi_{explore}(x) \propto \exp(-\lambda \times penalty(x)) \times I(x\ satisfies\ hard\ constraints)$

_(Penalty function definition remains the same as the original PRD Section 4.2.1, incorporating efficiency, compactness, and station coverage soft constraints.)_

**Exploration Strategy:**
The RSIS algorithm samples from $\pi_{explore}$ using:

1. **Proposal Distribution Q(x):** Heuristics (capacity/closeness bias) guide the growth at each step.
2. **Valuation Function V(x):** Lookaheads guide the intermediate resampling of active particles (see Section 4.3.4).

where **I(x satisfies hard constraints)** = 1 if all of the following hold, 0 otherwise:

- Minimum capacity: Σ(x_i × capacity_i) ≥ target_capacity
- Minimum area: Σ(x_i × area_i) ≥ target_area
- Contiguity: ≥50% of district area in single portion (checked via `validate_contiguity()`)
- Gross density: density ≥ 15 units/acre
- Station coverage: coverage ≥ threshold (community-specific)

**Penalty function** (soft constraints for exploration efficiency):

```
penalty(x) =
  + w_efficiency × max(0, capacity/target - efficiency_alpha)^2
  + w_efficiency × max(0, area/target - efficiency_alpha)^2
  + w_compact × (1 - compactness(x))
  + w_station × max(0, target_coverage - station_coverage(x))^2

where compactness(x) is the Polsby-Popper ratio:
  compactness(x) = 4π × area / perimeter²  ∈ [0,1]
  (1 = perfect circle, 0 = highly irregular)
```

**Note on station coverage penalty:** This is one-sided, only penalizing configurations that fall below the required station area threshold. Configurations exceeding the threshold are not penalized, as there is no statutory preference against higher station coverage.

**Note on compactness:** Compactness is NOT a legal requirement under 760 CMR 59. Setting `w_compact = 0` (default) produces a uniform distribution over all legally compliant plans. Users may set `w_compact > 0` to bias toward compact shapes if modeling realistic municipal behavior. The compactness metric is computed only at particle completion, not at each step.

**Key design choices:**

- **Hard constraints** enforced by setting weight = 0 (particle dies)
- **Soft constraints** guide exploration but don't truncate state space
- **Efficiency bound** (α) is soft-only to avoid biasing distribution
- **Compactness** (optional, default 0): Can encourage spatially coherent zones
- **Station coverage penalty** helps particles meet station area requirements

**Pure SIS approach (no tempering):** Penalty weight λ is a constant scalar applied only at completion:

- Particles grow using capacity-weighted + closeness proposals (no penalty-based weighting during propagation)
- Penalty computed once when particle completes (Tier 3)
- Importance weight: `w ∝ exp(-λ × penalty) / proposal_path_prob`
- Default: λ = 1.0 (moderate penalty strength)
- This keeps exploration simple and efficient while achieving the desired target distribution

**Purpose of penalties:** These penalties exist purely for computational efficiency—to guide SMC toward compliant configurations faster via biased proposals. They do NOT reflect substantive policy preferences and will be removed via SIR correction.

#### 4.2.2 Final Target (After SIR Correction)

The final target distribution for hypothesis testing is uniform over all compliant configurations:

**Final distribution $\pi_{uniform}$:**

$\pi_{uniform}(x) \propto I(x\ satisfies\ hard\ constraints)$

**SIR correction (Revised):** Each sampled plan has an exploration weight $W_{explore}$ calculated during the RSIS process.

$W_{explore}(x) \propto \pi_{explore}(x) / Q'(x)$
(Where $Q'(x)$ is the effective proposal distribution resulting from Q(x) and resampling).

We apply a correction factor $C(x)$ to adjust from $\pi_{explore}$ to $\pi_{uniform}$.

$C(x) = \pi_{uniform}(x) / \pi_{explore}(x) = \exp(\lambda \times penalty(x))$

**Final Uniform Weight $W_{uniform}(x)$:**
$W_{uniform}(x) = W_{explore}(x) \times C(x)$

Resampling proportional to $W_{uniform}$ restores the uniform distribution.

**Result:** The final reference distribution is uniform over compliant plans, suitable for testing the null hypothesis that adopted plans are not systematically biased.

### 4.3 SMC Algorithm Components (Revised)

#### 4.3.1 Initialization (Step 0)

For each particle m = 1, ..., M:
_(Seed selection and Tier 1/Tier 2 state initialization remains the same as the original PRD Section 4.3.1.)_

```r
# Initialize RSIS tracking variables
# CRITICAL: Initialize cumulative log probability of proposal path
# If seed selection is non-uniform, start with log(P_seed). Assuming uniform here.
log_proposal_path^(m)_0 = 0

# Initialize status
particle_active^(m) = TRUE        # Particle starts in the active population

# Initialize Valuation Score (for resampling)
valuation_score^(m)_0 = V(x^(m)_0)

   # For Tier-2 infeasibility checking:
   # Identify connected component containing seed parcel i
   component_id^(m) = get_component_id(i, adjacency_graph)
   # Initialize remaining capacity/area in this component
   remaining_capacity^(m)_0 = total_component_capacity[component_id] - capacity_i
   remaining_area^(m)_0 = total_component_area[component_id] - area_i
   # Initialize remaining station capacity/area (for station coverage bounds)
   remaining_station_capacity^(m)_0 = total_station_capacity[component_id] - capacity_i × I(i in station area)
   remaining_station_area^(m)_0 = total_station_area[component_id] - area_i × I(i in station area)
```

**Seed selection strategies:**

- **Random in station area:** Default, samples from all station-adjacent parcels
- **High capacity:** Biased toward parcels with high unit capacity
- **Municipal seed:** Start from parcel near town center
- **Reference plan:** Use adopted plan's core as seed for status-quo constraint

#### 4.3.2 Propagation (Iterative)

The algorithm iterates until the active population is empty or the target number of completed plans is reached. In each iteration:

For each active particle m:

```r
1. Identify boundary parcels B^(m). (If empty, mark particle inactive/dead).

2. Calculate raw proposal scores q_raw(j | x^(m)).
   # Proposal mechanism uses heuristics:
   q_raw(j) ∝ (capacity_j)^γ_cap × (closeness_j)^γ_close

3. Normalize and Calculate Z_proposal:
   Z_proposal = Σ_{k ∈ B^(m)} q_raw(k)

4. Sample addition j ~ q_raw(·) / Z_proposal.

5. Update proposal path Q(x):
   proposal_prob = q_raw(j) / Z_proposal
   # CRITICAL: Update the tracked proposal path
   log_proposal_path^(m) += log(proposal_prob)

6. Create proposed state: x^(m)_new = x^(m) ∪ {j}

7. TIER 1 - Update running sums (O(1)).
   # (Increment total capacity/area, decrement remaining capacity/area - Same as original PRD)

8. TIER 2 - Infeasibility check (O(1)).
   # (Check if mathematically impossible to succeed - Same as original PRD)

   if (infeasible):
       particle_active^(m) = FALSE  # Particle dies
       continue to next particle

9. TIER 3 - Completion check.

   # Check if particle has met minimum requirements
   if (total_capacity^(m) >= target_capacity AND total_area^(m) >= target_area):

       # Stochastic Continuation (prevents first-hit bias)
       # Note: In RSIS, P(continue) does not need to be tracked in Q(x) if it depends only on the current state.
       if (runif(1) < p_continue):
           # Continue growing
           # Update valuation for next step's resampling
           valuation_score^(m) = V(x^(m)_new)
           continue to next particle
       else:
           # Stop growing and run full compliance
           # (Full compliance check logic using evaluate_compliance() - Same as original PRD)

           if (compliance$summary$compliant):
               # SUCCESS: Calculate Final Importance Weight (W_explore)

               # 1. Calculate penalty (for π_explore)
               penalty = calculate_penalty(compliance, efficiency_alpha)
               particle_penalty^(m) = penalty

               # 2. Calculate Target probability (unnormalized)
               # π_explore(x) ∝ exp(-λ × penalty)
               log_target_prob = -λ * penalty

               # 3. Calculate Importance weight W_explore: ratio of target to proposal
               # log(W) = log(π(x)) - log(Q(x))
               log_W_explore^(m) = log_target_prob - log_proposal_path^(m)

               # Store the final log weight (we will normalize during SIR)
               # Move to completed population
               particle_active^(m) = FALSE
               # (Store the completed plan and its log_W_explore)

           else:
               # Fails hard constraints (e.g., contiguity, density)
               particle_active^(m) = FALSE # Particle dies
               continue to next particle
   else:
       # Particle not yet complete, continue growing
       # Update Valuation Score for next step's resampling
       valuation_score^(m) = V(x^(m)_new)
```

**Termination (with stochastic continuation):** Particle stops growing when:

- **Completion with stochastic continuation:**
  - If total_capacity ≥ target_capacity AND total_area ≥ target_area:
    - With probability (1 - p_continue): mark as complete and run Tier-3 compliance check
    - With probability p_continue: continue growing to sample larger plans
  - This stochastic continuation prevents "first-hit bias" (concentrating at minimums)
  - Improves effective sample size (ESS) by sampling the full range of plan sizes
  - Default: p_continue = 0.2 (20% chance to continue after reaching minimums)
- **No boundary:** No adjacent parcels available (rare - zone hit geographic limit)
- **Note:** Efficiency bound (α) is NOT a termination rule; it's enforced via penalty only

**Why 3-tier checking works:**

- **Tier 1** (every step): O(1) arithmetic updates, ~0.001 sec per step
- **Tier 2** (every step): O(|boundary|) infeasibility check, kills impossible particles early
- **Tier 3** (only on completion): ~0.03 sec per particle with precomputation
- **Result:** Average particle takes ~40 steps to complete, so we do 40× cheap checks and 1× expensive check instead of 40× expensive checks

#### 4.3.3 Resampling (Adaptive)

Resampling concentrates computational effort on promising active particles. It is performed adaptively on the **Active population only**.

```r
1. Identify active particles: P_active = {m : particle_active^(m) == TRUE}
   M_active = length(P_active)

2. Normalize Valuation Scores (acting as weights for resampling):
   V_norm^(m) = valuation_score^(m) / Σ_{m ∈ P_active} valuation_score^(m)

3. Calculate Effective Sample Size (ESS) of the active population:
   ESS_active = 1 / Σ_{m ∈ P_active} (V_norm^(m))^2

4. If ESS_active < M_active * resample_threshold (e.g., 0.5):
   # Perform Systematic or Multinomial Resampling
   - Draw M_active new particles with replacement from P_active
   - Probability of selecting particle m = V_norm^(m)

   - **CRITICAL: Copy ALL particle state to offspring particles:**
     * x^(m) (parcels in zone)
     * All Tier 1 and Tier 2 running sums (total_capacity, remaining_capacity, etc.)
     * log_proposal_path^(m) (MUST be copied; ensures final W_explore remains valid)
     * component_id^(m)
```

#### 4.3.4 Valuation Function V(x) (NEW)

The Valuation Function $V(x)$ estimates the potential of a partial plan $x$ to reach a compliant final state. It guides the intermediate resampling. $V(x)$ leverages the Tier 2 lookahead metrics already computed.

**Proposed Valuation Function:**

```r
V(x) = (Reachable_Capacity(x) / Target_Capacity)^α_V ×
       (Reachable_Station_Coverage(x) / Target_Coverage)^β_V

where:
- Reachable_Capacity(x) = total_capacity^(m) + remaining_capacity^(m)
  (Maximum capacity achievable in the connected component, tracked in Tier 1/2)

- Reachable_Station_Coverage(x) = max_area_coverage (calculated in Tier 2 infeasibility check)
  (Maximum station area coverage achievable)

- α_V, β_V: Tuning parameters (default 1.0) controlling the influence of these factors.
```

**Behavior:** If a particle expands into an area with low remaining capacity or poor station access, its $V(x)$ decreases, making it more likely to be eliminated during resampling.

**Why resample?** Concentrates computational effort on high-probability regions, eliminates low-weight particles.

**Adaptive resampling:** Only resample when ESS drops below threshold, saving computation when weights are relatively uniform.

**IMPORTANT:** When resampling creates offspring particles, ALL cached state must be copied from the parent, especially `log_proposal_path`. If this cumulative probability is not copied, the final importance weight calculation will be incorrect, breaking the SMC correction.

#### Adaptation (Optional enhancement)

**Tuning proposal parameters during simulation:**

```r
After every K particles complete:
1. Calculate acceptance statistics:
   - Avg. compactness of completed particles
   - Avg. station coverage
   - Distribution of final sizes

2. Adjust proposal parameters:
   - If zones too sprawling: increase γ_close
   - If zones too small/large: adjust target parameters
   - If too many particles dying: decrease λ schedule rate
```

#### 4.3.6 Performance Optimization Strategy

The 3-tier checking architecture enables realistic performance targets by avoiding expensive compliance checks during propagation.

**Tier 1: Running Sums (Every Step)**

- **Purpose:** Track particle state with cheap arithmetic
- **Operations:**
  - Increment capacity, area, station metrics: O(1)
  - Update parcel list (append)
- **Cost:** ~0.001 seconds per step
- **Implementation:** Store in `ParticleState` object with cached sums

**Tier 2: Infeasibility Tests (Every Step)**

- **Purpose:** Kill particles that cannot possibly succeed
- **Logic:** Uses running totals maintained in particle state (updated in Tier 1)

  ```r
  # Can this particle reach minimums even if we add ALL remaining parcels
  # in its connected component?
  #
  # remaining_capacity^(m): Capacity in component not yet in zone
  # remaining_area^(m): Area in component not yet in zone
  # (Decremented each step as parcels are added)

  if (total_capacity^(m) + remaining_capacity^(m) < target_capacity OR
      total_area^(m) + remaining_area^(m) < target_area):
    kill_particle()  # Mathematically impossible to succeed
  ```

- **Cost:** O(1) arithmetic ≈ 0.001 seconds (simple comparison of cached values)
- **Precomputation:** Connected components identified once; total capacity/area per component cached in mbta_map
- **Runtime tracking:** `remaining_capacity^(m)` and `remaining_area^(m)` decremented in Tier 1 as zone grows
- **Benefit:**
  - Prevents futile propagation of doomed particles
  - Avoids false kills (checks full connected component, not just immediate boundary)
  - Maintains O(1) cost via running totals instead of recomputing reachable sets

**Tier 3: Full Compliance (On Completion Only)**

- **Purpose:** Validate all hard constraints when particle reaches minimum requirements
- **Operations:**
  - Extract particle parcels from precomputed data
  - Check contiguity via `validate_contiguity()`
  - Check full compliance via `evaluate_compliance()` with `precomputed = TRUE`
- **Cost:** ~0.03 seconds per particle (with spatial precomputation)
- **Frequency:** Only when particle completes (~once per 40 propagation steps)

**Performance Calculation:**

For typical municipality (e.g., Chelsea with 1,234 parcels):

```
Assumptions:
- Target: 10,000 completed plans
- Particles: M = 50,000 (5x oversampling due to failures)
- Avg. steps to completion: 40

Total propagation steps: 50,000 × 40 = 2,000,000 steps

Tier 1 cost: 2,000,000 × 0.001 sec = 2,000 sec = 33 min
Tier 2 cost: 2,000,000 × 0.001 sec = 2,000 sec = 33 min
Tier 3 cost: 50,000 × 0.03 sec = 1,500 sec = 25 min

Resampling: negligible (<10 sec)
Total: ~90 minutes for 10,000 plans WITHOUT precomputation

WITH precomputation (existing infrastructure):
- Tier 3 cost: 50,000 × 0.001 sec = 50 sec (1000x speedup)
- Total: ~5 minutes for 10,000 plans
```

**Why this works:**

- **Avoid repeated spatial operations:** Expensive GIS calculations done once via `precompute_spatial_attributes()`
- **Defer expensive checks:** Only call `evaluate_compliance()` when absolutely necessary
- **Early termination:** Infeasibility checks prevent wasted computation on impossible particles
- **Parallelization:** Each particle independent, trivial to parallelize across cores

**Integration with existing package:**

```r
# Setup (once per municipality)
parcels <- load_municipality("chelsea.zip")
stations <- load_station_areas()

parcels_precomputed <- precompute_spatial_attributes(
  parcels,
  station_areas = stations
)

# SMC uses precomputed data throughout
chelsea_map <- mbta_map(parcels_precomputed, precomputed = TRUE)
plans <- mbta_smc(chelsea_map, nsims = 10000)

# 3-tier checking happens automatically:
# - Tier 1-2: Running sums and infeasibility (pure arithmetic)
# - Tier 3: evaluate_compliance() uses precomputed columns (no spatial ops)
```

---

## 5. Package API Design (Following `redist` Pattern)

### 5.1 Core Object Types

#### `mbta_map` Object

Analogous to `redist_map`, stores the zoning problem definition:

```r
# Constructor
mbta_map(
  data,                          # sf data frame with parcels (from load_municipality())
  existing_plan = NULL,          # reference zoning district (optional)
  ndists = 1,                    # number of districts (usually 1)
  total_capacity = "unit_capacity", # column name for unit capacity
  pop_tol = 0.25,               # capacity tolerance (as fraction)
  community_type = "commuter_rail", # MBTA community category
  adj = NULL,                    # adjacency list (auto-computed if NULL)

```r
# Structure (inherits from data.table for performance)
class(plans)
#> [1] "mbta_plans" "redist_plans" "data.table" "data.frame"

# Columns (automatically created):
# - draw, district, parcel_id, ... (statistics: total_capacity, etc.)
# - particle_penalty: Penalty value P(x) at completion (for SIR correction)

# NEW/REVISED Columns for RSIS/SIR:
# - log_proposal_path: Cumulative log probability of the proposal path Q(x) (CRITICAL)
# - log_weight_explore: The log importance weight log(W_explore) = log(π_explore / Q(x))
# - weight_uniform: The final weight after SIR correction W_uniform (normalized)

# Attributes (metadata):
# - lambda: Constant penalty weight used in π_explore (scalar)
# - sir_corrected: Boolean, whether SIR correction has been applied

# Access underlying assignment matrix
get_plans_matrix(plans)  # Returns matrix: parcels × plans

# Example
print(plans)
#> `mbta_plans` object with 1000 plans and 1 district
#>
#> Municipality: Chelsea
#> Reference plan: `existing`
#>
#> Plan statistics:
#>   total_capacity: 2,500—3,100 (target: 2,500)
#>   total_area: 50—62 acres (target: 50)

#>   station_coverage: 88%—95% (target: 90%)
#>   contiguity: 92%—100% (min: 50%)
```

**Data.table Integration:**

```r
# Use data.table syntax for fast aggregation
plans[, .(
  mean_capacity = mean(total_capacity),
  sd_capacity = sd(total_capacity)
), by = draw]

# Fast filtering
high_density_plans <- plans[gross_density > 20]

# Join with parcel attributes
plans[chelsea_map$data, on = "parcel_id"]
```

#### `mbta_constr` Object

Analogous to `redist_constr`, stores constraint configuration:

```r
# Constructor
mbta_constr(map)

# Constraint addition functions
add_constr_compactness(constr, strength = 1)
add_constr_status_quo(constr, strength = 1, ref_plan = NULL)
add_constr_demographics(constr, strength = 1, measure = "segregation")
add_constr_redevelopment(constr, strength = 1, prefer_high = TRUE)

# Example
cons <- mbta_constr(chelsea_map) %>%
  add_constr_compactness(1.5) %>%
  add_constr_redevelopment(0.5, prefer_high = TRUE)
```

### 5.2 Main Simulation Function

```r
mbta_smc(
  map,                         # mbta_map object
  nsims = 1000,                # number of plans to sample
  constraints = NULL,          # mbta_constr object (optional)

  # Exploration Target Parameters (π_explore - Soft Constraints)
  compactness = 1.0,           # compactness strength (used in π_explore)
  lambda = 1.0,                # constant penalty weight
  efficiency_alpha = 1.25,     # soft upper bound multiplier
  efficiency_strength = 1.0,   # penalty weight for exceeding efficiency bound

  # Proposal Distribution Parameters (Q(x) - Heuristics for efficient exploration)
  gamma_cap = 0.5,             # Bias toward high-capacity parcels
  gamma_close = 1.0,           # Bias toward closeness (compact growth)

  # SMC Parameters
  M = NULL,                    # number of particles (default: nsims * 5)

  # Computational
  runs = 2,
  ncores = 1,

  # Advanced RSIS Parameters
  resample_threshold = 0.5,    # ESS threshold for resampling active population
  p_continue = 0.2,            # stochastic continuation probability

  # NEW: Valuation Function Tuning
  valuation_alpha = 1.0,       # α_V: Exponent for capacity in V(x)
  valuation_beta = 1.0,        # β_V: Exponent for station coverage in V(x)

  # SIR correction (post-processing)
  apply_sir = TRUE,            # automatically apply SIR correction to restore uniform
  return_weights = FALSE,
  # ...
)
```

**Parameter details:**

- **compactness**: Weight for compactness penalty in target distribution. Default 0 produces a uniform distribution over all legally compliant plans (compactness is NOT a legal requirement under 760 CMR 59). Set to `compactness > 0` to bias toward spatially compact zones, modeling realistic municipal behavior. Uses Polsby-Popper ratio (4π × area / perimeter²) computed at particle completion.

- **lambda**: Constant penalty weight applied at particle completion (pure SIS, no tempering). Default 1.0. This scalar value controls the strength of soft penalties (compactness, efficiency, station coverage) during SMC exploration. Higher values more strongly bias the exploration distribution, requiring stronger SIR correction. The final distribution after SIR is uniform regardless of lambda value. Users typically don't need to adjust this.

- **efficiency_alpha**: Controls soft upper bound on zone size. Zones with capacity > α × target_capacity or area > α × target_area incur quadratic penalty. Default 1.25 allows zones up to 25% above minimum before penalty applies. Set to `Inf` to disable efficiency bound entirely.

- **efficiency_strength**: Weight for efficiency penalty in target distribution. Higher values more strongly discourage oversized zones. Default 1.0 balances efficiency with other soft constraints (station coverage).

- **p_continue**: Probability of continuing to grow a particle after it reaches minimum capacity and area requirements. Default 0.2 (20% chance). This **stochastic continuation** prevents "first-hit bias" where all plans cluster at the minimum size, improving effective sample size (ESS) by sampling the full range of compliant plan sizes. Set to 0 to stop immediately at minimums; set higher (e.g., 0.5) to sample more oversized plans.

- **apply_sir**: Whether to automatically apply SIR correction after SMC completes. Default TRUE. When enabled, the returned plans object contains a uniform distribution over compliant configurations, suitable for hypothesis testing. Set to FALSE to examine the raw exploration distribution or apply custom corrections.

- **return_weights**: If TRUE, stores importance weights in the returned plans object without resampling. Useful for diagnostics or custom SIR corrections. Requires apply_sir = FALSE.

**Note on penalties and SIR:** Soft penalties exist purely for computational efficiency during SMC exploration—they guide particles toward feasible regions but create bias. SIR correction (enabled by default via apply_sir = TRUE) removes this bias, restoring a uniform distribution. The final distribution is uniform over compliant plans regardless of penalty strengths used during exploration.

**Example usage:**

```r
# Basic simulation (default: pure uniform over legally compliant plans)
plans <- mbta_smc(chelsea_map, nsims = 1000)

# With compactness bias (for behavioral realism)
plans_compact <- mbta_smc(
  chelsea_map,
  nsims = 1000,
  compactness = 1.5  # Bias toward spatially compact zones
)

# High-performance (10K plans, 8 cores, 4 runs)
# Uses precomputed attributes for ~1000x speedup
# Default compactness = 0 produces pure legal uniform distribution
plans <- mbta_smc(
  chelsea_map,
  nsims = 10000,
  runs = 4,
  ncores = 8
)
```

### 5.3 Preprocessing Functions

Following `redist` pattern for map manipulation, using data.table operations:

```r
# Filter parcels (updates adjacency automatically)
chelsea_map_filtered <- chelsea_map
chelsea_map_filtered$data <- chelsea_map$data[property_value < 1e6]
chelsea_map_filtered$adj <- build_adjacency(chelsea_map_filtered$data)

# Merge parcels by attribute
chelsea_map_merged <- merge_parcels_by(
  chelsea_map,
  by = "neighborhood",
  drop_geom = FALSE
)

# Freeze parcels (for status-quo constraint)
chelsea_map$data[, frozen := adopted_zone == 1]

# Create district cores (preserve center of adopted district)
chelsea_map$data[, core := identify_district_core(geometry, boundary = 1)]
```

### 5.4 Analysis Functions

Functions for analyzing `mbta_plans` objects, using data.table for performance:

```r
# Match district numbers to reference plan
plans <- match_numbers(plans, chelsea_map$existing_plan)

# Calculate plan-level statistics (using data.table)
plans <- calculate_plan_statistics(
  plans,
  map = chelsea_map,
  measures = c("pct_minority", "median_value", "pct_commercial")
)

# Data.table aggregation
plan_summary <- plans[, .(
  compliant = all(total_capacity >= 2500 & total_area >= 50),
  avg_value = mean(median_value)
), by = draw]

# Statistical comparison with reference
compare_to_reference(plans, chelsea_map, measure = "pct_minority")
#> Characteristic: pct_minority
#> Reference value: 0.42
#> Simulated mean: 0.38
#> Simulated SD: 0.05
#> Percentile of reference: 0.82
#> P-value (two-tailed): 0.36
```

### 5.5 Post-Processing: SIR Correction

After SMC generates plans using the penalized exploration distribution, apply Sampling/Importance Resampling (SIR) to restore a uniform distribution over compliant configurations.

#### 5.5.1 Why SIR Correction is Needed

**Problem:** SMC uses soft penalties during propagation for computational efficiency (guiding particles toward compact, contiguous configurations). This creates a bias—the exploration distribution π_explore favors certain characteristics over others.

**Solution:** SIR reweights and resamples to correct for this bias, producing a final distribution that is truly uniform over compliant plans.

#### 5.5.2 SIR Algorithm

```r
apply_sir_correction <- function(
  plans,                 # mbta_plans object from mbta_smc()
  lambda = NULL,         # lambda value used in SMC
  nsims = NULL,
  return_weights = FALSE
) {

  # (Extract lambda if needed)
  if (is.null(lambda)) lambda <- attr(plans, "lambda")

  # Extract penalties and exploration log weights
  penalties <- plans$particle_penalty
  log_W_explore <- plans$log_weight_explore

  # Calculate Correction Factor C(x) = π_uniform / π_explore = exp(λ × penalty)
  # Calculate Final Uniform Weights W_uniform = W_explore × C(x)
  # Use log space for numerical stability:
  # log(W_uniform) = log(W_explore) + λ × penalty

  log_W_uniform <- log_W_explore + lambda * penalties

  # Normalize using log-sum-exp trick
  max_log_W <- max(log_W_uniform)

  # Check for simulation failure (all weights are -Inf)
  if (is.infinite(max_log_W) && max_log_W < 0) {
      stop("All weights are zero. Simulation failed.")
  }

  W_uniform_unnorm <- exp(log_W_uniform - max_log_W)
  normalized_weights <- W_uniform_unnorm / sum(W_uniform_unnorm)

  if (return_weights) {
    plans$weight_uniform <- normalized_weights
    return(plans)
  }

  # Resample plans proportional to W_uniform
  n_successful <- nrow(plans[normalized_weights > 0])
  n_final <- if (is.null(nsims)) n_successful else min(nsims, n_successful)

  if (n_final == 0) {
      stop("No successful plans generated.")
  }

  resampled_indices <- sample(
    1:nrow(plans),
    size = n_final,
    replace = TRUE,
    prob = normalized_weights
  )

  # Create corrected plans object
  final_plans <- plans[resampled_indices, ]
  final_plans$draw <- 1:n_final  # Renumber draws

  attr(final_plans, "sir_corrected") <- TRUE
  return(final_plans)
}
```

#### 5.5.3 Usage Examples

**Basic workflow:**

```r
# Run SMC with penalties for efficient exploration
plans_raw <- mbta_smc(
  chelsea_map,
  nsims = 10000,
  lambda = 1.0,  # Constant penalty weight (pure SIS)
  compactness = 1.5
)

# Apply SIR correction to restore uniform distribution
plans_uniform <- apply_sir_correction(plans_raw)

# Now use plans_uniform for hypothesis testing
compare_to_reference(plans_uniform, chelsea_map, "pct_minority")
```

**Automatic SIR (default behavior):**

```r
# If apply_sir = TRUE (default), mbta_smc() automatically applies correction
plans <- mbta_smc(
  chelsea_map,
  nsims = 10000,
  apply_sir = TRUE  # default
)
# plans is already SIR-corrected
```

**Diagnostic workflow:**

```r
# Compare distributions before/after SIR correction
plans_raw <- mbta_smc(chelsea_map, nsims = 5000, apply_sir = FALSE)

# Examine exploration distribution (penalized)
hist(plans_raw$compactness)
mean(plans_raw$total_capacity)

# Apply SIR and compare
plans_uniform <- apply_sir_correction(plans_raw)
hist(plans_uniform$compactness)  # Should be more spread out
mean(plans_uniform$total_capacity)  # Similar mean, higher variance

# Check effective sample size
plans_with_weights <- apply_sir_correction(plans_raw, return_weights = TRUE)
ESS <- 1 / sum(plans_with_weights$sir_weight^2)
cat("Effective sample size:", ESS, "out of", nrow(plans_raw), "\n")
```

#### 5.5.4 Theoretical Justification (Revised)

**RSIS Exploration:** The algorithm rigorously tracks the proposal probability Q(x) (`log_proposal_path`). By copying this path during resampling events, the final importance weight $W_{explore}$ remains valid, even though the effective proposal distribution $Q'(x)$ (resulting from Q(x) and resampling via V(x)) is complex.
$W_{explore}(x) \propto \pi_{explore}(x) / Q'(x)$

**Targets:** $\pi_{explore}(x) \propto \exp(-\lambda \times penalty(x))$; $\pi_{uniform}(x) \propto 1$.

**Importance Weight Correction:** We multiply by the correction factor $C(x) = \pi_{uniform}(x) / \pi_{explore}(x) = \exp(\lambda \times penalty(x))$.

$W_{uniform}(x) = W_{explore}(x) \times C(x)$
$W_{uniform}(x) \propto (\pi_{explore}(x) / Q'(x)) \times (\pi_{uniform}(x) / \pi_{explore}(x))$
$W_{uniform}(x) \propto \pi_{uniform}(x) / Q'(x)$

**Result:** Resampling proportional to $W_{uniform}(x)$ yields the desired uniform distribution.

#### 5.5.5 Diagnostics and Validation

```r
# Check that SIR correction removes penalty bias
validate_sir_correction <- function(plans_raw, plans_corrected) {

  # Correlation between penalty and weight
  plans_w <- apply_sir_correction(plans_raw, return_weights = TRUE)
  cor(plans_w$particle_penalty, plans_w$sir_weight)
  # Should be positive (higher penalty → higher weight)

  # Compare characteristic distributions
  compare_distributions <- function(var) {
    data.frame(
      raw_mean = mean(plans_raw[[var]]),
      raw_sd = sd(plans_raw[[var]]),
      corrected_mean = mean(plans_corrected[[var]]),
      corrected_sd = sd(plans_corrected[[var]])
    )
  }

  compare_distributions("compactness")
  # Corrected should have higher variance (less peaked)

  compare_distributions("total_capacity")
  # Mean similar, variance higher

  # Effective sample size
  ESS <- 1 / sum(plans_w$sir_weight^2)
  ESS_ratio <- ESS / nrow(plans_raw)
  # Should be > 0.5 (if < 0.5, may need more SMC samples)

  return(list(
    ESS = ESS,
    ESS_ratio = ESS_ratio,
    weight_penalty_cor = cor(plans_w$particle_penalty, plans_w$sir_weight)
  ))
}
```

## 8. Dependencies

New dependencies to add to DESCRIPTION:

```r
# Add to Imports:
parallel,     # For multi-core SMC execution
igraph        # For advanced adjacency operations (optional)

# Already in package (will leverage):
sf,           # Spatial operations
data.table,   # High-performance data manipulation
cli,          # User-facing messages
purrr         # Functional programming
```

**Note:** Package already uses `data.table` instead of `dplyr/tidyr`, which is optimal for SMC performance.

---

## 9. Integration with Existing Functions

The SMC algorithm will integrate with existing package infrastructure:

### 9.1 Compliance Evaluation

**Existing function:** `evaluate_compliance()`

**SMC usage:**

```r
# In propagation step, use existing compliance function
compliance <- evaluate_compliance(
  municipality = particle_parcels,
  districts = NULL,  # single district = all parcels
  zoning_params = map$zoning_params,
  community_type = map$community_type,
  precomputed = map$precomputed,
  verbose = FALSE
)

# Extract constraint satisfaction
constraints_met <- all(
  compliance$summary$compliant,
  compliance$summary$total_units >= map$target_capacity,
  compliance$summary$total_area >= map$target_area
)

# Use for particle weighting
weight <- if (constraints_met) exp(-lambda * penalty(compliance)) else 0
```

### 9.2 Spatial Precomputation

**Existing function:** `precompute_spatial_attributes()`

**Integration with 3-tier checking:**

The SMC algorithm leverages existing precomputation infrastructure for maximum performance:

```r
# Setup phase (once per municipality)
parcels <- load_municipality("inst/extdata/parcels/57_CHELSEA_basic.zip")
transit_stations <- load_station_areas()

# Precompute ALL spatial intersections (one-time cost)
parcels_precomputed <- precompute_spatial_attributes(
  municipality = parcels,
  station_areas = transit_stations,
  verbose = TRUE
)

# Create map with precomputed attributes
chelsea_map <- mbta_map(
  parcels_precomputed,
  community_type = "rapid_transit",
  precomputed = TRUE
)

# Run SMC - 3-tier checking uses precomputed data throughout:
# - Tier 1: Running sums from precomputed capacity, area columns
# - Tier 2: Infeasibility checks using cached sums (no spatial ops)
# - Tier 3: evaluate_compliance() uses precomputed station_area_sf,
#           density_deduction_area columns (no spatial intersections)
plans <- mbta_smc(chelsea_map, nsims = 10000)

# Performance with precomputation:
# - 10,000 plans in ~5 minutes
# - ~1000x faster than without precomputation
# - All spatial operations done once in setup, not repeated for each particle
```

**Why precomputation enables realistic performance targets:**

- Spatial intersections (st_intersection, st_area) are expensive: ~0.03 sec each
- Without precomputation: 50K particles × 0.03 sec = 25 minutes just for Tier 3
- With precomputation: Tier 3 reads cached columns instead of computing intersections
- Result: Tier 3 drops from 0.03 sec to 0.001 sec per particle (~30x faster)

### 9.3 Contiguity Validation

**Existing function:** `validate_contiguity()`

**SMC usage:**

```r
# In propagation step, check contiguity constraint
is_contiguous <- validate_contiguity(
  district = particle_parcels,
  threshold = 0.5  # 50% of district must be contiguous
)

if (!is_contiguous) {
  weight <- 0  # Kill particle
}
```

### 9.4 Adjacency Graph

**New function** (builds on existing sf operations):

```r
# Build adjacency graph from sf data using rook adjacency
build_adjacency <- function(parcels_sf) {
  # Use rook adjacency (shared boundary) instead of queen (corner-touch)
  # Pattern "F***1****" ensures boundary intersection (shared edge, not just point)
  # This avoids fragile corner-touch connections that can create thin corridors

  adjacency_matrix <- sf::st_relate(
    parcels_sf,
    parcels_sf,
    pattern = "F***1****"  # Boundary-boundary intersection
  )

  # Convert to adjacency list format (for efficient graph operations)
  adj_list <- purrr::map(adjacency_matrix, as.integer)

  return(adj_list)
}
```

**Why rook adjacency:**

- **Queen adjacency** (`st_touches()`): Includes corner-touch connections
- **Rook adjacency** (`st_relate` with boundary pattern): Requires shared edge
- **Benefit:** Avoids fragile single-point connections that can violate contiguity intent
- **Trade-off:** Slightly more restrictive, but more robust for legal compliance

**SMC usage:**

```r
# In mbta_map constructor
if (is.null(adj)) {
  cli::cli_alert_info("Building adjacency graph...")
  adj <- build_adjacency(data)
  cli::cli_alert_success("Adjacency graph built: {length(adj)} parcels")
}
```

## 10. Performance Requirements

### 10.1 Computational Targets

**With precomputation (using `precompute_spatial_attributes()`):**

- 1,000 plans: <1 minute
- 10,000 plans: <10 minutes (target: ~6 minutes with optimization)
- 100,000 plans: <2 hours (with parallelization)

**Breakdown for 10,000 plans (Chelsea, 1,234 parcels):**

```
Assumptions:
- Target: 10,000 completed plans
- Particles: M = 50,000 (5x oversampling due to ~80% failure rate)
- Avg. steps to completion: 40

Total propagation steps: 50,000 × 40 = 2,000,000 steps

Performance with 3-tier checking + precomputation:
- Tier 1 (running sums): 2,000,000 × 0.00010 sec = 200 sec = 3.3 min
  (Pure vectorized arithmetic in R: increment cached sums)
- Tier 2 (infeasibility): 2,000,000 × 0.00005 sec = 100 sec = 1.7 min
  (Simple comparisons of cached values)
- Tier 3 (compliance):   50,000 × 0.001 sec = 50 sec = 0.8 min
  (Only at completion, uses precomputed columns)
- Resampling:            ~10 sec
- Total:                 ~6 minutes

Without precomputation (Tier 3 spatial ops not cached):
- Tier 3 alone:          50,000 × 0.03 sec = 1,500 sec = 25 min
- Total:                 ~30 minutes

**Note:** These are conservative estimates for pure R implementation. Actual
performance will be validated via profiling. If Tier 1-2 dominate runtime,
optimization strategies include: (1) vectorizing more aggressively with data.table,
(2) batch processing particles, or (3) porting critical loops to Rcpp.
```

**Why 3-tier checking achieves this:**

- **Avoids 2M expensive compliance checks:** Only check when particle completes
- **Early termination:** Tier 2 kills impossible particles, reducing wasted Tier 3 calls
- **Precomputation:** Tier 3 reads cached columns instead of computing intersections

**Parallel scaling:**

- Linear speedup with ncores (up to physical cores)
- 10,000 plans on 8 cores: ~40 seconds

### 10.2 Memory Requirements

- Particle state: ~1 KB per particle (just running sums, not full geometry)
- Plan storage: ~10 KB per completed plan (parcel IDs + statistics)
- Precomputed parcels: ~2 MB for 5,000 parcels (loaded once, shared)
- **Total: <500 MB for typical run (M = 50,000 particles, 10,000 plans)**

### 10.3 Optimization Strategies

1. **3-tier checking architecture:** Defer expensive checks to completion only
2. **Precomputation:** Use existing `precompute_spatial_attributes()` for ~1000x Tier 3 speedup
3. **Running sums:** Cache particle state, avoid recomputing aggregates
4. **Infeasibility tests:** Kill impossible particles early (Tier 2)
5. **Data.table:** Use data.table for fast aggregations (already in package)
6. **Parallel processing:** Run independent SMC runs in parallel
7. **Adaptive resampling:** Only resample when ESS < threshold

---

## 11. Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful if:

1. **Validity:** 100% of sampled plans meet hard constraints (verified by `evaluate_compliance()`)
2. **Diversity:** Plan diversity metric in range 0.5–0.8
3. **Reproducibility:** R-hat < 1.05 across multiple runs
4. **Efficiency:** Can generate 10,000 plans for typical municipality in <10 minutes (with precomputation and optimization)
5. **Scalability:** Works for municipalities with 10,000+ parcels
6. **API Consistency:** Follows `redist` patterns and integrates seamlessly with existing `mbtazone` functions
7. **Documentation:** Complete vignettes and function documentation (Roxygen2)
8. **Testing:** >95% code coverage for SMC functions

## 15. Technical Corrections from Review (Updated for v2.0)

This section documents corrections made based on expert review feedback of v1.0, leading to the adoption of the v2.0 design.

### Summary of v2.0 Redesign (Methodology Correction)

The initial SMC design (v1.0/v1.1) contained critical mathematical flaws related to inconsistent weighting, incorrect resampling procedures, and flawed SIR correction. Version 2.0 corrects these by adopting a **Valuation-Guided Sequential Importance Sampling with Resampling (RSIS)** framework.

**Key Changes in v2.0:**

1. **Valuation-Guided Resampling (Sections 4.3.3, 4.3.4):** Introduced a Valuation Function V(x) based on Tier 2 lookaheads to guide intermediate resampling. This provides efficient, guided exploration (similar to tempering) while remaining tractable for this problem structure.
2. **Rigorous Proposal Tracking (Section 4.3.2):** Implemented meticulous tracking of the cumulative proposal probability Q(x) (`log_proposal_path`).
3. **Corrected Weight Calculation (Section 4.3.2):** The final importance weight $W_{explore}$ is correctly calculated as $\pi_{explore}(x) / Q(x)$ only at completion.
4. **Sound Resampling Procedure (Section 4.3.3):** Resampling is applied only to the active population, and crucially, the `log_proposal_path` is copied to offspring particles, preserving the validity of the final importance weights.
5. **Corrected SIR Implementation (Section 5.5.2):** The SIR correction step now correctly incorporates the exploration weights $W_{explore}$ and the correction factor $C(x)$, utilizing log-space calculations for stability.
6. **Data Structure Updates (Section 5.1.2):** `mbta_plans` object updated to store `log_proposal_path` and intermediate log weights.

**Impact:** The v2.0 algorithm is mathematically sound, ensuring samples correctly represent the target distribution. It provides the efficiency benefits of guided SMC exploration and integrates seamlessly with the existing 3-Tier optimization strategy.

### Issue 1: Propagation Feasibility Logic (HIGH - CRITICAL)

**Problem identified:**

> "Applying every hard compliance check after each parcel addition will zero-out almost all particles until they hit the minimum units/acreage thresholds (the partial zones will fail min-capacity/min-area at every intermediate step), so the SMC will die out immediately unless you change the feasibility logic in propagation."

**Resolution:**
Implemented **3-tier checking strategy** (Section 4.3.2, 4.3.6):

- **Tier 1 (every step):** Update running sums (capacity, area, station metrics) - O(1) arithmetic
- **Tier 2 (every step):** Infeasibility test - "can this particle possibly succeed?" - kills mathematically impossible particles early
- **Tier 3 (on completion only):** Full compliance check via `evaluate_compliance()` - only when particle reaches minimum requirements

**Impact:** Reduced compliance checks from 2M per run to ~50K per run (40x reduction), making 5-minute/10K-plan target achievable.

**Affected sections:** 4.3.2 (Propagation), 4.3.6 (new Performance section), 6 (Implementation), 10 (Performance)

---

### Issue 2: SMC Weight Update Formula (HIGH - THEORETICAL CORRECTNESS)

**Problem identified:**

> "The weight update ignores the proposal density and instead multiplies by exp(-λ penalty), which means the sampler targets a different, undetermined distribution; the text also overclaims that final particles are independent."

**Resolution:**

- **Corrected weight update** (Section 4.3.2):
  ```r
  # Correct SMC importance sampling:
  proposal_prob = q(j | x_{t-1}) / Z_proposal  # Normalized proposal
  target_prob = exp(-λ × penalty(x_t))
  weight_t = weight_{t-1} × (target_prob / proposal_prob)  # Importance ratio
  ```
- **Removed independence claim** (Section 4.1): Changed "independent draw" to "weighted samples that approximate the target distribution"
- **Clarified target** (Section 4.2): Specified hard constraints (weight = 0) vs soft constraints (penalty function)

**Impact:** Algorithm now correctly samples from specified target distribution π(x).

**Affected sections:** 4.1 (Why SMC), 4.2 (Target Distribution), 4.3.2 (Propagation)

---

### Issue 3: Efficiency Bound Soft vs Hard (MEDIUM - CONSISTENCY)

**Problem identified:**

> "The 'efficiency bound' is described as soft, yet the termination rule enforces it as a hard cutoff; that truncates the state space and directly conflicts with the uniform-null framing unless you document the resulting bias and run sensitivity checks on α."

**Resolution:**

- **Removed from termination rule** (Section 4.3.2): Particles no longer terminate when exceeding α × target
- **Added to penalty function** (Section 4.2):
  ```r
  penalty(x) = ... + w_efficiency × max(0, capacity/target - α)^2
                  + w_efficiency × max(0, area/target - α)^2
  ```
- **Made α configurable** (Section 5.2): Added `efficiency_alpha` and `efficiency_strength` parameters
- **Documented rationale** (Section 3.3): Explains efficiency bound prevents extremely large zones while avoiding state space truncation

**Impact:** Efficiency bound is now purely soft, avoiding distribution bias. Users can set α = Inf to disable or vary for sensitivity analysis.

**Affected sections:** 3.3 (Constraints), 4.2 (Target), 4.3.2 (Propagation), 5.2 (API)

---

### Issue 4: Contiguity Specification (MEDIUM - CLARIFICATION)

**Problem identified:**

> "Contiguity is listed as 'at least 50%' which does not match either the statute or the existing compliance helper that requires the whole overlay to be contiguous; this discrepancy needs to be resolved or justified."

**Resolution:**

- **Verified against existing code** (R/gis_operations.R:1019-1216): `validate_contiguity()` checks ≥50% in largest contiguous portion + 5-acre minimum for other portions
- **Added clarification box** (Section 3.3): Distinguishes contiguity (50% of area in single spatially connected portion) from station coverage (50-90% of capacity in station buffers)
- **Cited statute** (Section 3.3): 760 CMR 59.04(3)(d) per existing documentation
- **Specification was correct** - reviewer's concern appears to conflate contiguity with station coverage

**Impact:** No algorithm changes needed. Added clear explanation to prevent future confusion.

**Affected sections:** 3.3 (Constraints - added explanation box)

---

### Issue 5: Performance of Compliance Calls (MEDIUM - OPTIMIZATION)

**Problem identified:**

> "Re-running evaluate_compliance() on freshly subset sf objects inside every propagation step will be very expensive; without cached incremental metrics or a cheaper feasibility test, the five-minute/10k-plan target looks unreachable."

**Resolution:**
Integrated with Issue 1 solution (3-tier checking):

- **Tier 1:** Cache running sums in particle state, avoid recomputing aggregates every step
- **Tier 2:** Cheap infeasibility test avoids futile propagation
- **Tier 3:** Only call `evaluate_compliance()` when particle completes (~once per 40 steps, not every step)
- **Precomputation integration** (Section 9.2): Leverages existing `precompute_spatial_attributes()` for ~1000x speedup

**Performance calculation** (Section 10):

```
Without optimization: 2M compliance calls × 0.03 sec = 1,000 min
With 3-tier + precomputation:
  - 2M Tier 1-2 checks × 0.001 sec = 66 min
  - 50K Tier 3 checks × 0.001 sec = 1 min
  - Total: ~5 minutes ✓
```

**Impact:** 5-minute/10K-plan target is achievable with existing infrastructure.

**Affected sections:** 4.3.2 (Propagation), 4.3.6 (Performance), 9.2 (Integration), 10 (Requirements)

---

### Summary of Changes

**Sections modified:** 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3.2, 5.2, 6, 9.2, 10
**Sections added:** 4.3.6 (Performance Optimization), 15 (this section)
**Lines changed:** ~300 lines revised or added

**Reviewers:** Thank you to the expert reviewer for identifying these critical issues before implementation. The corrected algorithm is now theoretically sound, computationally feasible, and properly integrated with existing package infrastructure.

### 15.2 MVP Design Decisions

This section documents key design decisions for the MVP (Phase 1) implementation, deferring certain features to later phases based on research priorities and development constraints.

#### Single-Component Overlays Only (Phase 1)

**Decision:** The MVP implementation supports only single-component (fully contiguous) overlay districts, deferring multi-component support to Phase 2.

**Legal context:**

- Massachusetts law (760 CMR 59.04(3)(d)) permits multi-component overlays:
  - ≥50% of district area must be in one contiguous portion
  - Remaining area can be in separate portions ≥5 acres each
- Many municipalities adopt multi-component plans in practice

**Rationale for single-component MVP:**

1. **Municipal preference:** Most adopted plans use single-component designs for simplicity and administrative ease

2. **Conservative bias test:** Restricting to single-component plans makes the reference distribution more conservative:

   - Tests bias within the subset of "simpler" feasible plans
   - If bias is detected in this restricted space, it's still meaningful
   - If no bias detected, can expand to multi-component in Phase 2

3. **Implementation complexity:** Multi-component support requires:

   - {grow, spawn} move types instead of simple grow-only
   - Component management and gating rules (≥5 acre enforcement)
   - More complex state tracking and resampling
   - This complexity can be added incrementally after MVP validation

4. **Research timeline:** Single-component implementation allows faster validation of:
   - Core SMC algorithm correctness
   - SIR correction effectiveness
   - Performance targets with real data
   - Integration with existing compliance functions

**Phase 2 extension path:**

- Add `component_spawn` move type to propagation step
- Track multiple components per particle with area/capacity per component
- Gate non-largest components: only keep if ≥5 acres at completion
- Update initialization to precompute per-component reachable sets
- Validate that multi-component support preserves correctness

**Documentation requirement:** All user-facing documentation and function help files must clearly state:

> "This implementation generates single-component (fully contiguous) overlay districts. Multi-component overlays (permitted under 760 CMR 59.04(3)(d)) are not currently supported."

#### Pure R Implementation (Phase 1)

**Decision:** The MVP uses pure R with vectorized operations and data.table, deferring Rcpp optimization to later phases.

**Rationale:**

1. **Premature optimization:** Rcpp adds development complexity without validating that optimization is needed:

   - Pure R may meet performance targets with proper vectorization
   - Profiling real workloads will identify actual bottlenecks
   - Optimization effort should focus on measured hot paths

2. **Developer experience:** Team has R expertise but limited Rcpp experience:

   - Pure R allows faster iteration during algorithm development
   - Reduces debugging complexity during initial validation
   - Enables easier contributions from R-focused team members

3. **Maintenance burden:** Rcpp introduces build dependencies and platform-specific issues:

   - Complicates package installation for users
   - Requires compiler toolchain on user machines
   - Pure R package is more portable and easier to distribute

4. **Performance hypothesis:** With proper optimization, R may be adequate:
   - Vectorized operations on cached data structures
   - data.table for high-performance aggregations
   - Precomputation eliminates most spatial operations
   - Target: ~6 minutes for 10K plans (realistic for optimized R)

**Optimization workflow:**

1. **Profile first:** Use `profvis` on real municipality data
2. **Vectorize:** Batch particle operations where possible
3. **Cache aggressively:** Precompute everything possible
4. **Only then Rcpp:** If profiling shows Tier 1-2 dominate and R optimization is exhausted

**Rcpp migration path (if needed):**

- Port Tier 1-2 particle propagation to C++ (hot path)
- Use `Rcpp::NumericVector` for running sums
- Implement bitset-based membership tracking
- Expose tight `step_particles(particles, n_steps)` function
- Keep Tier 3 (compliance evaluation) in R (reuses existing functions)

**Success criteria:**

- Pure R implementation meets 10-minute target for 10K plans
- If profiling shows >50% time in Tier 1-2 and target missed, consider Rcpp

#### Optional Compactness (Default 0)

**Decision:** Compactness penalty weight defaults to 0, producing uniform distribution over all legally compliant plans.

**Rationale:**

1. **Legal basis:** Compactness is NOT a requirement under 760 CMR 59:

   - No statutory language mandating compact shapes
   - Compliance model does not check compactness
   - Including it as default biases the null hypothesis

2. **Research validity:** Default `compactness = 0` produces the cleanest null:

   - "Adopted plan is uniform over all legally compliant configurations"
   - No additional substantive assumptions about municipal preferences
   - Users can explore behavioral realism by setting `compactness > 0`

3. **Flexibility:** Optional parameter supports multiple research questions:
   - **Legal null** (`compactness = 0`): Pure statutory compliance
   - **Behavioral baseline** (`compactness > 0`): Realistic municipal preferences
   - **Sensitivity analysis:** Vary compactness to assess robustness

**User guidance:**

- Default `compactness = 0`: For hypothesis testing against legal null
- Set `compactness = 1-2`: To model realistic municipal behavior
- Document clearly in vignettes which setting is appropriate for each research question
